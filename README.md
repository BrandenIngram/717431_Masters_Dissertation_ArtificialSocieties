# 717431_Masters_Dissertation_ArtificialSocieties
This repository was created to provide some additional resources for my Dissertation titled : Emerging behaviours in Artificial Societies : Simulating social-economic phenomena

This repository contains videos and images which demonstrate how the visualiser (as Discussed in the document) works as well as additional
visualisations of a couple of the experiments conducted in the research.

Additionally a JAR File which can be used to visualise a specific experiment has been made available. Instructions on how to use it can be seen below.

Download the visualiser 


The first image below represents the main screen of the visualiser before the visaulisation of an experiment has been started. On the Left is our grid of cells representing the world. On the top left you can also see an episode counter and finally on the right is the menu options. To start the visualisation press the start button. If at any point you want to pause the visaulisation press the pause button.

The additional check boxes can be selected (clicked) to visaulise a particular aspect of the simulation. Take care to only have a single check box selected at a time as multiple with ruin the formatting of the visualiser. Thereofore rather deselect (click again) first before selecting the next aspect you would like to visualise.

The 3 images below depict a visaulisation with the different aspects being selected.
