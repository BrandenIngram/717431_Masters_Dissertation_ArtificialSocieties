This repository was created to provide some additional resources for my Dissertation titled : Emerging behaviours in Artificial Societies : Simulating social-economic phenomena

This repository contains videos and images which demonstrate how the visualiser (as Discussed in the document) works as well as additional visualisations of a couple of the experiments conducted in the research. The links to these can be found at the bottom of this page

Additionally a RAR file containg all the required files to operate the stand-alone visualiser has been provided. Instructions on how to use it can be seen below.

Step1: Download the RAR file.

Step2: Once it has been downloaded extract all the files contained within.

Step3: You will find a file called Visualiser.jar

Step4: In order to run the file you will need to have java installed on your computer, java can be downloaded here https://java.com/en/download/

Step5: Open command prompt/terminal/powershell in the same directory as the jar file.

Step6: In the command window type: java -jar Visualiser.jar

Step7: The application window should have opened if successful.


Read the outline below on how to use the visualiser now that it is running.

The first image below represents the main screen of the visualiser before the visaulisation of an experiment has been started. On the Left is our grid of cells representing the world. On the top left you can also see an episode counter and finally on the right is the menu options. To start the visualisation press the start button. If at any point you want to pause the visaulisation press the pause button.

The additional check boxes can be selected (clicked) to visaulise a particular aspect of the simulation. Take care to only have a single check box selected at a time as multiple with ruin the formatting of the visualiser. Thereofore rather deselect (click again) first before selecting the next aspect you would like to visualise.

The 3 images below depict a visaulisation with the different aspects being selected.
